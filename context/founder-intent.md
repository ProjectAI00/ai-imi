# Founder Intent: Why IMI Exists

I do **not** want to be the person giving 100 instructions all day.

I do **not** want to be the one operating every step manually.

I want to test ideas quickly, decide what is worth it, and think less.

I want the upside of 100x agents running in parallel **without** 100x mental load.

IMI should act like one trusted ops agent that:

- communicates clearly, like a calm friend
- is not overwhelming
- understands each project deeply
- uses previous sessions, worktrees, and context automatically
- remembers where we are going and keeps us aligned
- helps with complex work so humans can focus on judgment, not orchestration

Core product requirement:

> Reduce cognitive load.  
> Fewer decisions for the human.  
> Better outcomes with less manual steering.

If a feature does not reduce mental load, it is not core.
