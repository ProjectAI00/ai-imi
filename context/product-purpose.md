# Product Purpose

<!-- last-verified: 2026-02-14 -->

## What IMI Does

IMI is an AI ops system for technical startup teams.
It turns goals into executable work, runs agent workflows, and reports only what matters.

## Core Problem

Building with AI agents creates high cognitive load:

- too many tools, chats, terminals, and configs
- too much manual steering
- poor continuity across sessions
- unclear signal on what to build vs defer

## Product Goal

Reduce human mental load while increasing shipped outcomes.

The user should only need to:

1. define goals and quality bar
2. approve risky decisions
3. review high-signal outcomes

Everything else should be automated through the plan -> execute -> verify -> summarize loop.

## Who It's For

- startup founders
- technical product teams
- teams shipping quickly with AI agents

## Success Criteria

- fewer manual instructions per session
- fewer decisions required per day
- faster cycle time from idea to verified change
- clear Now / Next / Blocked / Defer visibility

## Non-Goals

- becoming a static docs/wiki tool
- becoming a generic project board like legacy PM tools
- maximizing feature count over reducing cognitive load
